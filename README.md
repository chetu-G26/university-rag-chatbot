# ðŸŽ“ University RAG Chatbot 
A Production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot developed as a capstone project at the University of New Haven. This intelligent assistant leverages semantic search and large language models (LLMs) to answer queries from students and faculty in real time.

> ðŸš€ Built with FastAPI, Ollama Mistral 7B, ChromaDB, Apache Airflow, and deployed on AWS EC2.

- Scrapes university website data
- Cleans and chunks text
- Embeds chunks with MiniLM
- Stores vectors in ChromaDB
- Uses LLM (Mistral 7B) to generate responses
- Updates monthly with Apache Airflow
